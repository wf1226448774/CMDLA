We input the instruction manual document into the RPLM model to obtain both textual and visual representations of the document.  These representations are then used for image-text matching and structured text information extraction, which together help in constructing a knowledge graph for the manual.  Using the data mentioned above as an example, the visualization of the constructed manual knowledge graph is shown in the following figure:
